### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a hard-working student and data analyst passionate about applied statistics, programming and videogames.

Although being self-taught in computer science, I thrive in a proactive team environment.

I have experience in creating SQL/Python dataflows to feed data visualizations on Power BI and R, as well as communicating complex ideas.

I am also a Data Science graduate student at Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech. Meanwhile I am doing and internship as a Data Analyst at FCC Medio Ambiente.
