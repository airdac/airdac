### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a hard-working student passionate about mathematics, programming and videogames.

Given my natural team-working and teaching abilites, I am proactive, and enjoy most when collaborating in projects.

I have experience in creating SQL/Python dataflows to feed data visualizations on Power BI and R, as well as communicating complex ideas.

I am also a Data Science graduate student at Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech. Meanwhile I am graduating as a Mathematics Highschool Teacher at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.
